`make_debug_miniature_dataset.R` just takes the mutation full data and slices the first 300 mutations as debug smaller dataset
`make_genome_positions.R` just contains the ad hoc function needed to recode the gene names so we can use the nomenclature used by Susan and Angela when aggregating covariates
